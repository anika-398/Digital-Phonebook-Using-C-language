# Digital-Phonebook-Using-C-language
#Simple digital phonebook where new records can be added, deleted, edited etc.
This is a digital phonebook program. We have used various types of  
functions for different work. Our used data types and functions are:
1) structure, 2)char, 3) int, 4) array, 5) EOF6) function, 7) string, 8)fflush(stdin) and others.
2) First,we used a function named switch_menu()to choose the things we want to do  
between search, edit, list, and delete. We have also mentioned which number we  
have to press for which work. We have created a file named phonebook file.txt 
to store the information that the user entered. We have used switch-case again to  
choose the extension of email that we can merge the extension with the username  
of email in list, search, and delete functions. We have used fflush (stdin) to free the memory. In this program we can enter data, search, delete, display list and edit. Invalid information does not store in phonebook file.txt file and do not show in the  output.
